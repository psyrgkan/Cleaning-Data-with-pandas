# Cleaning-Data-with-pandas
Exploring data of fraudulent job postings, cleaning and building a predictive model.  
  
In this project I processed, cleaned and explored data from various job postings. After feature engineering I came up with useful information that could help me see patterns in the data. I then further converted non-numerical variables using a target encoder. Finally I implemented both a Decision Tree model for easy visualization to predict which postings are fraudulent, and a Random Forest model.   
  
The latter had an accuracy of aroun 96.38% on the test data, with a maximum depth of 10. While the DT model did not underperform either with a stunning 95.97% with a max depth of just 3. Which constitutes evidence of great feature engineering, and the use of correct encoding for the non-numeric variables.
